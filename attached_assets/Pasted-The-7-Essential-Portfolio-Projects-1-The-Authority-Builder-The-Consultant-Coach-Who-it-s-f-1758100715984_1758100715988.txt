The 7 Essential Portfolio Projects:
1. The "Authority Builder" (The Consultant/Coach)

Who it's for: A business coach, marketing consultant, or financial advisor.

The Problem: Their business runs on trust and credibility, but their current site looks generic and doesn't communicate their unique value.

Your Solution Showcase:

A homepage with a powerful, benefit-driven headline and sub-headline.

A robust "About/Story" page that builds personal connection.

Detailed case studies that follow the Problem -> Solution -> Result framework.

A clear, high-value offer (e.g., "Book a Discovery Call").

2. The "Visual Storyteller" (The Creative Professional)

Who it's for: An architect, interior designer, or high-end photographer.

The Problem: Their work is visual and stunning, but their portfolio is a cluttered gallery that doesn't guide the user or explain the project.

Your Solution Showcase:

3. The "Product Salesman" (The Artisan/Maker)

Who it's for: A jewelry maker, ceramicist, or custom furniture builder.

"About the Maker" section that highlights the craftsmanship and process.

4. The "Results Machine" (The B2B Service)

Who it's for: A digital marketing agency, web development firm, or specialized contractor.

The Problem: They need to prove they deliver a Return on Investment (ROI) to other businesses, not just show pretty work.

Your Solution Showcase:

Homepage focused on client results (e.g., "We increased leads by 150% for a SaaS company").

Testimonials from recognizable clients or with specific, quantifiable praise.

Skill Demonstrated: Data presentation, analytics, and understanding business KPIs.

5. The "Hybrid Portfolio" (The Modern Professional)

Who it's for: A UX designer, content creator, or public speaker who does both project-based work and personal branding.

The Problem: They need to showcase specific work and build their personal thought leadership platform on the same site.

Your Solution Showcase:

A clear separation between "Work" (case studies) and "Blog/Podcast/Thoughts" (content).

A design that balances showcasing projects with highlighting their unique personality and perspective.

6. The "Navigation Masterclass" (The Content-Heavy Expert)

Who it's for: A researcher, academic, writer, or photographer with a vast archive of work.

The Problem: They have hundreds of projects, articles, or photos. Users need to be able to filter and find specific things easily without being overwhelmed.

Your Solution Showcase:

Advanced filtering and search functionality (by year, project type, industry, tag).

Individual project pages that are consistent and easy to scan.

The Problem: Their work is unconventional, and their portfolio needs to reflect their unique voice and stand out from the corporate crowd, without sacrificing usability.

Your Solution Showcase:

A daring, unique design that reflects their brand personality (e.g., bold typography, unconventional layouts, subtle animations).

Proof that you can be creative without compromising on core principles like loading speed, mobile responsiveness, and clear user pathways.

A focus on creating a memorable experience that visitors talk about.

Skill Demonstrated: Art direction, technical execution of advanced design, and balancing creativity with usability.

How to Present These in Your Portfolio:
For each project, don't just show the final website. Create a case study that includes:

The Client's Problem: Who were they and what was their challenge?

Your Strategy: How did you decide on the structure, design, and content?

The Solution: Images of the final product.

The Result (if possible): "Client saw a 40% increase in contact form submissions" or "Client landed a major project they attribute to the new portfolio."
